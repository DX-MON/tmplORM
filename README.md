# tmplORM

A template metaprogramming based Object Relationship Manager (ORM).  
When I went looking at the state of ORMs in C++, I was disappointed to find absolutely nothing that did not need external tools and cludgy hacks such as unsupportable #pragma directives to work  
This caused me to set out to program something efficient that solves the problem and plugs the gap, all with just the compiler.
